## Features

- **Easy installation:** native DLSS games, or compatible non-DLSS games through DLSS5-Feeder.
- **Your library:** Steam, Epic, GOG, modern Xbox Game Pass folders, and manually added games/emulators.
- **Search and filters:** combine title, graphics API, DLSS status/version and add-ons; click counters to filter.
- **Flexible layout:** group by store or show everything in one list, with game artwork and light/dark themes.
- **Controlled scanning:** full-drive scanning is **off by default**. Added folders still scan normally; enable all-drive discovery or remove scan folders in Settings.
- **Right-click shortcuts:** open/copy folder, rescan, change cover, restore originals or hide a game.
- **Backups and History:** restore original files, keep installation records, and copy History/activity/install logs.
- **Save diagnostics:** one file with the install log, the game’s own ReShade and Feeder logs, the manifest and your driver - shown to you before it is written, and ready to attach to a report.
- **In-game overlay:** press **F8** to open the app's own panel over the running game and move the real DLSS Neural Rendering sliders while you play. Supports the **DLSS5-Feeder** and **RenoDX v4.7** routes only. Drag the grip in its bottom right corner to resize it; each game remembers its own size.
- **Rendering API override:** optional, per game, with **Automatic** as the default; detection is never overwritten.
- **Custom add-ons:** the Add-ons page remains available alongside the integrated installation routes.
- **Multipass neural rendering:** an installation route that runs the neural pass up to ten times per frame, on DX12, DX11 and 64-bit DX9 - including games with no DLSS of their own.
- **Community (BETA):** read what worked for other people, narrowed to the games on your PC and the graphics card in it, leave your own report, and talk it over underneath it. Opt-in, and everything you leave can be edited, deleted or withdrawn.
- **Community chat:** one live room for everyone using the app - screenshots, game cards, replies with mentions and reactions.

## New in 2.2.7

Find the reviews that matter to you, hear about it when people answer you - and every fix promised on the tracker.

### ✨ New

**1 · Filter by your graphics card** - pick your card in the Community filter and see only the reviews from people with that same card. Your own card is always the first choice.

<p><img src="docs/screenshots/15-feature-gpu-filter.png" alt="The Community page filtered to your own graphics card" width="100%"></p>

**2 · Only the reviews from your card** - open any game with the filter on, and it starts on what people with your card found. Everyone else is one click away.

<p><img src="docs/screenshots/16-feature-gpu-reviews.png" alt="A game opened on the reviews from people with your graphics card" width="100%"></p>

**3 · Reviews for your games** - switch to **My games** and the page shows only the games installed on your PC, tagged when DLSS 5 is already in them.

<p><img src="docs/screenshots/17-feature-my-games.png" alt="My games: community reviews for the games installed on this PC" width="100%"></p>

**4 · See it before you install** - open any game in your library: what the community found for it is right above the install button.

<p><img src="docs/screenshots/18-feature-before-install.png" alt="What the community found, in the game's page right above Install" width="100%"></p>

Also new: **My comments** (everything you reported, in one place), **Sort** by most recent, most reports or A-Z, API tags on every card ([#288]), and **notifications** when someone mentions you in the chat, replies to you there, or reacts to your review or your message.

### 🔧 Fixed

| | |
|---|---|
| **DirectDraw never installed** | dgVoodoo was downloaded only for DX8 and DX9, so every DirectDraw game failed with `errDgVoodooMissing` - Gens and the other emulators included ([#292], [#279], [#150]) |
| **Prey, Titanfall 2, Call of Duty 2 and Max Payne read as "No 3D executable"** | Their renderer is a DLL beside the executable. A Direct3D library in the executable's own folder is now enough to offer it ([#259], [#249]) |
| **Portal was filed under Half-Life 2** | Both run `hl2.exe`, and no report ever carried the store id it should have. An executable many games share - `hl2.exe`, every emulator - no longer decides which card a report lands on ([#274]) |
| **The read-only ReShade.ini banner came back** | 2.2.5 cleared it only when a game was opened in the app. Every game this app installed into is checked once each time it starts ([#155]) |
| **Games under Program Files failed with `EPERM`** | Windows protects that folder. The install now says so up front, in words: run as administrator, or move the game ([#301]) |
| **The driver warning read like a wall** | It is a warning: many people run newer drivers without trouble, especially with MSI Afterburner and RivaTuner closed. It says so now ([#300], [#278]) |
| **"DLSS was installed normally" before it was** | The overlay message appeared before the install finished, even when it then failed ([#275]) |
| **Uninstalling left ReShade in games** | Uninstalling never touches game folders. The uninstaller now says so and points to **Restore originals** first ([#266]) |

## Earlier releases

Each one is written up in full - what broke, why, and what was changed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **2.2.6** | [Community chat](docs/releases/v2.2.6.md) - one live room for everyone, and the right add-on on every route |
| **2.2.5** | [Multipass](docs/releases/v2.2.5.md) - the neural pass up to ten times per frame, plus nine faults fixed at the cause |
| **2.2.4** | [The Community page](docs/releases/v2.2.4.md) - compare notes with everyone else, plus eight faults fixed at the cause |
| **2.2.3** | [Six reported faults, fixed at the cause](docs/releases/v2.2.3.md) - OptiScaler on older cards, a game's own stale shader compiler, the overlay on a scaled display |
| **2.2.2** | [The reports people sent](docs/releases/v2.2.2.md) - games it could not find, installs it refused, the overlay's own page |
| **2.2.1** | [The Overlay page](docs/releases/v2.2.1.md) - themes you can write yourself, and a preview that runs before you choose |
| **2.2.0** | [Optional OptiScaler and a smarter library](docs/releases/v2.2.0.md) |

Every release also carries its own notes and downloads on the
[releases page](https://github.com/rakanki911/DLSS5-Swapper/releases).

## Compatibility

| Category | Support |
| --- | --- |
| **System** | Windows 10/11 x64; compatible 32-bit and 64-bit games |
| **ReShade / Feeder GPUs** | RTX 20 / 30 / 40 / 50; older-series support is reported by the bundled modified runtime's author |
| **OptiScaler GPUs** | 64-bit games with native DLSS enabled. The bundled neural model runs on **Blackwell** (RTX 50 / RTX PRO Blackwell); an older card needs a modded `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` you supply, which is never overwritten. Driver **616.56** recommended |
| **DirectX 12** | Native DLSS, Feeder, or eligible OptiScaler games |
| **DirectX 11** | Feeder for 32/64-bit games; eligible OptiScaler games |
| **DirectX 9 / 8** | DX9: 32/64-bit; DX8: 32-bit, through dgVoodoo2 → DX11 → Feeder |
| **Vulkan / OpenGL** | ReShade/Feeder; eligible Vulkan games can also use OptiScaler |
| **DirectX 10** | Not directly supported by Feeder; choose DX11 when available |
| **In-game overlay** | 64-bit DirectX 11 / 12 games with ReShade add-on support; **DLSS5-Feeder and RenoDX v4.7 only** |

OptiScaler's DX11/Vulkan path uses a DX12 bridge with FSR output by default.
For Vulkan backend changes, **restore originals first**. OptiScaler is not the emulator/non-DLSS route.

## Emulators

Select the emulator folder and its active renderer, then use **ReShade/Feeder**.

## Before installing

- **Anti-cheat:** red warning and optional confirmation, not a blanket block. Injection can cause crashes or account bans; the app never bypasses anti-cheat.
- **Requirements:** Feeder needs Visual C++ runtimes (x64, plus x86 for 32-bit games). Some components download on first use.
- **Compatibility is not guaranteed.** Keep backups; existing mods may conflict. Not every reported game crash is fixed.
- **Linux/Proton:** experimental community source only; no Linux binaries in this release.

## Community and privacy

- Opening the Community page downloads public game reports. A live connection
  count is held only in memory; no connection identifiers are stored.
- A report is sent only after you review and submit the fields shown in its
  dialog: game, route, rendering API, result, optional comment, GPU, driver,
  CPU, OS and app version.
- The app uses a random install ID to prevent duplicate votes. The server stores
  only its hash. **Remove my community activity** hides all your reports and
  replies and resets your public community profile.
- The owner-only administrator access code is verified by the community server
  and stored locally with Windows encrypted storage. It is never written to the
  public profile or the normal community settings file.

## Support
